This is an illustration how to do Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Fine Food Reviews on a dataset publically available from this site:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews

2) How can we rate food reviews automatically, using the scale Positive, Neutral and Negative?

Amazon Food Review contains 1000 lines of data
Out of these 1000 lines the distribution of the Reviewers voting 1 to 5 are shown in the Figure below:
